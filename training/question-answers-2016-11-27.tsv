Now it's time for me to buy a flight ticket from China to New York. So I need to know whether I am required to attend SEAS welcome day on August 19th, 2016. Is attendance mandatory on that day?  If not, I may arrive in New York a few days later after that day. Otherwise, I will have to rearrange my travel plan and arrive in New York early.	While Grad SEAS Welcome Day activities are not mandatory, we strongly encourage incoming graduate students to attend to meet fellow classmates, administrators, and faculty. These activities are intended to help familiarize new students with University resources and build community before everyone gets busy with academics. That said, we understand there are unavoidable circumstances which may delay your arrival in New York.   Please join us for as many of the Fall Welcome Day activities listed here as possible. You will be responsible for learning the material that is covered, which will also be shared via email.	Required	Welcome Day

I had accepted the offer for the MS in EE program on the 8th of April, 2016. Apart from the acknowledgement I had received after accepting the offer, I have not received any further correspondence from Columbia university. Also I am not able to activate my UNI. Sir, could you please look at the above situation and inform me as soon as something comes out of it.	Have you been able to activiate your UNI? It typically takes a few days to populate in our student information systems.	Issue	Uni	
I accepted my offer through the online portal last week and was expecting that I would be hearing from you today( MOnday, 25th April).  I have not received housing information, UNI and email id yet. Could you please look into this issue and resolve it soon?	To activate your UNI, please see instructions here.	Issue	Uni	
I think I had already successfully activate my UNI and applied for housing. Do I need to do them again?	No need to do anything twice.	Issue	Uni	
Before I activate my UNI, I was wondering if there is any way to get a simpler email address (e.g., msalama@columbia or mark.salama@columbia). I understand if that is not possible but thought I should ask.	Regarding your UNI, please activate as-is and create an alias for yourself; instructions for doing so are available here.

I am also yet to receive information regarding UAH and UNI, though it has been a week since I accepted my offer through the university portal. Please look into this issue as well. I am worried that I might lose out on the opportunity to receive UAH because of unexpected delays at the university's end.	It takes several days for your information to populate in our student information systems. Please know housing decisions will not be made until July, so there is nothing to worry about.

Is there any possibility that UAH would process the housing decision faster for individuals in special situations?	UAH allocation notifications will be sent in July, 2016. If you do not receive a notification from UAH, and your status does not change in the Housing Portal by August 12, 2016, you may consider your application waitlisted.	Notification	UAH	
Recently, I submit an application to UAH and the status have remained "In Process" for a long time. I'm kind of anxious because I don't know if I could have a place to live in New York.

Yes, you would have a better chance of getting an allocation in IHouse if you apply through both methods. It is up to you.	Chances	UAH	
I just wanted to let you know that I already submitted an application for housing before getting your e-mail, because I wanted to apply as soon as possible considering that the university housing is so limited.

It will therefore be very difficult for me to view apartments for rent, and I will need sufficient time to plan ahed and look for fall back plans. I do prefer on campus housing, but I know it's not guaranteed, so I wanted to know is it better to wait until my applications gets processed and I get a response or is there a time where I must start pursuing alternatives regardless?

 After I received my housing assignment today (Friday), I called UAH five times this afternoon to no answer and submitted a contact form through the housing site. Not sure if you're the right person to go to about this but since you hosted the housing webinar I figured I'd try reach out to you as well since I'm pretty desperate for a resolution to this issue. I will call UAH again first thing Monday morning. I'm sure this is a busy time of the year for you but I would be more than grateful for any help at all!                                                                                            So I'm an incoming PhD student in the electrical engineering department. In the housing application I indicated I'm not interested in the Arbor. Despite that, I was still assigned to the Arbor. This seems like a mistake because my friend, who is also an incoming SEAS PhD student, whom I specified as a roommate preference (who also specified me)--had the same thing happen to him: he was also assigned to the Arbor even though he didn't indicate interest in it, however, unlike me, he managed to get a call in to UAH Friday afternoon, and earlier this evening at 7pm he told me he was reassigned housing near campus.  I am absolutely certain living in the Arbor will not work for me, one reason being I will be working in the lab late--past shuttle hours--at which point returning to the Arbor will be prohibitively difficult. I feel I should get a reassignment just as another student did, as we are in equivalent situations. Please let me know if there's anything I can do to help fix this problem, such as being more flexible with my move in date. Thank you so much for your help. I'm looking forward to joining Columbia this fall.	Please call University Apartment Housing (UAH) regarding this issue, their number is availble here.	Issue	UAH

I tried registering for housing with the new sign up code, but the system shows an error saying that there is already an account with the CUID.I just logged-in with my previous account and submitted an application.

I'm an incoming first-year Ph.D. student in X Department. I'm a little concerned because I just received my housing assignment through UAH for the fall, and I have been assigned a move-in date of August 26, a week after orientation starts for the School of Engineering. Is this disparity in time a normal occurrence? Is there anything I can do to work out an earlier move-in date? I am not from the New York area, so not having a place to stay and not being settled while starting orientation is a bit worrisome to me. If it is relevant or useful, the preferences I put in my housing application were the weeks of 8/8, 8/1, and 7/25 (although I understand we were not guaranteed our preferences in move-in date.) Thank you very much for your time.	Thank you for your email. Unfortunately, we are unable to guarantee an earlier move-in date, but UAH may be able to accommodate you, hopefully by 8/18.

I'm writing to ask about if I want to defer my graduate study for a year, who or which department should I be contacting?	While we do not offer a deferral option at Columbia Engineering, we encourage you to apply again using the "reactivation" process.   The reactivation process allows you to use your existing application again and waive the application fee for next year. To initiate the reactivation of your application, please go back to our online application system in mid-August and follow the instructions for reactivation.  Most applicants who reactivate are accepted again the second time around, so please do not be overly concerned about your application being reviewed again. Due to the new pool of applicants each term, however, we can not guarantee admission. 	Defer		
Excuse me! My visa has some trouble now, and it is under checking processing.It is said that it may take four weeks or more time. I am afraid that my visa and passport cannot send back punctually.

I will be joining the MSOR program this fall and was hoping to secure housing before reaching New York. I am looking to get a single room at the International House for which I applied through the UAH application on May 19th. I wrote to CU Facilities, who advised me that the school must first approve my application before receiving an I-House offer. I would be grateful if you could please check for me if I am approved for I-House by the school?	If you have not received a positive notification from UAH by now, it is highly unlikely you will receive an allocation. I strongly encourage you to seek an alternate accommodation.

I've read about UAH housing and its waitlist policy, yet still have some questions as below.  I applied for UAH housing at the end of March, and received waitlist recently.

I have a question regarding housing. Brokers ask for a guarantor when we rent an apartment. Or we need to pay the rent upfront. Can the University provide any letter to help serve that purpose? Not all of us will have relatives in US and paying rent upfront is burdensome.	Information about housing for Grad SEAS students can be found here. Unfortunately, Columbia is unable to serve as a co-signer or guarantor for the purpose of renting an apartment.	Misc	Guarantor	
I have submitted the immunization documents as per the requirements on the 2nd of July and the hold has been removed by the CU Health today.

I was looking at housing options near the university but they are either out of my budget or without proper utilities. UAH has put me on waitlist, whereas one of my friends who applied 1 month later has already gotten an apartment through UAH. That maybe because she is in a different department. But since she already has housing available now, I am left alone for the hunt.  I have gone through several options till now but nothing has quite worked out yet. Most of the options I found had male roommates, or rent too high for me to afford, or they were unfurnished and without heat. Some demanded taking the room on lease for one complete year, which again is something that I cannot finalize sitting here. Since I am coming to US for the first time and I do not have any relatives or friends living there, I do not want to risk looking for an accommodation after reaching New York.  I contacted UAH office but they told me that these decisions are made by individual departments. I hereby request you to help me, if possible, to confirm a room through UAH, because I'm finding it extremely difficult to get a decent housing option near the university.	Thank you for your email. I understand that searching for housing in NY is challenging. While I understanding your hesitation in waiting to search for an accommodation until you arrive, that is my best recommendation since most rentals are listed for immediate move-in. It is also risky to sign a lease from abroad.  If you have not received a positive notification from UAH by now, it is highly unlikely you will receive a UAH allocation. I strongly encourage you to seek an alternate accommodation. As you may know, there are several resources available to help you do so here. The password is SEAS2016. In particular, I suggest posting the facebook housing group to find potential roommates and maximize your search.	Notification	UAH, Waitlist

I am currently also looking for alternative off-campus housing and it would be great if I could get an estimate on how long I should get a lease for.	For off-campus housing, most leases are for one year. Some students are able to get 18-month leases, but that is not always possible. If you have to sign a lease for a second year, you may consider sub-leasing your apartment for the remaining period between the end of your program and your departure from New York.
