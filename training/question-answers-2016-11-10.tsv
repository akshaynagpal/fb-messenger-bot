Now it's time for me to buy a flight ticket from China to New York. So I need to know whether I am required to attend SEAS welcome day on August 19th, 2016. Is attendance mandatory on that day?  If not, I may arrive in New York a few days later after that day. Otherwise, I will have to rearrange my travel plan and arrive in New York early.	While Grad SEAS Welcome Day activities are not mandatory, we strongly encourage incoming graduate students to attend to meet fellow classmates, administrators, and faculty. These activities are intended to help familiarize new students with University resources and build community before everyone gets busy with academics. That said, we understand there are unavoidable circumstances which may delay your arrival in New York.   Please join us for as many of the Fall Welcome Day activities listed here as possible.	Required	Welcome Day	
I am a newly admitted PhD student in electrical engineering beginning at Fall 2016.  I would like to ask a question about Welcome Day before buying my flight ticket. Is participating into Welcome Day on August 19 mandatory? Is it sufficient to participate in only the department specific orientation program?	You are strongly encouraged to attend the Welcome Day on August 19. The sessions will provide a lot of information that will allow you to activate your student status at Columbia and help you to understand the policies and processes for course registration and degree completion.

I had accepted the offer for the MS in EE program on the 8th of April, 2016. Apart from the acknowledgement I had received after accepting the offer, I have not received any further correspondence from Columbia university. Also I am not able to activate my UNI. Sir, could you please look at the above situation and inform me as soon as something comes out of it.	Have you been able to activiate your UNI? It typically takes a few days to populate in our student information systems.	Issue	Uni	
I accepted my offer through the online portal last week and was expecting that I would be hearing from you today( MOnday, 25th April).  I have not received housing information, UNI and email id yet. Could you please look into this issue and resolve it soon?	To activate your UNI, please see instructions here.	Issue	Uni	
I think I had already successfully activate my UNI and applied for housing. Do I need to do them again?	No need to do anything twice.	Issue	Uni	
Before I activate my UNI, I was wondering if there is any way to get a simpler email address (e.g., msalama@columbia or mark.salama@columbia). I understand if that is not possible but thought I should ask.	Regarding your UNI, please activate as-is and create an alias for yourself; instructions for doing so are available here.

I am also yet to receive information regarding UAH and UNI, though it has been a week since I accepted my offer through the university portal. Please look into this issue as well. I am worried that I might lose out on the opportunity to receive UAH because of unexpected delays at the university's end.

Recently, I submit an application to UAH and the status have remained "In Process" for a long time. I'm kind of anxious because I don't know if I could have a place to live in New York.

Yes, you would have a better chance of getting an allocation in IHouse if you apply through both methods. It is up to you.	Notification	UAH	
I just wanted to let you know that I already submitted an application for housing before getting your e-mail, because I wanted to apply as soon as possible considering that the university housing is so limited.

I just wanted to know when will my application approximately be processed. I am an international student, and I will arrive to the US in the beginning of August. It will therefore be very difficult for me to view apartments for rent, and I will need sufficient time to plan ahed and look for fall back plans. I do prefer on campus housing, but I know it's not guaranteed, so I wanted to know is it better to wait until my applications gets processed and I get a response or is there a time where I must start pursuing alternatives regardless?

 After I received my housing assignment today (Friday), I called UAH five times this afternoon to no answer and submitted a contact form through the housing site. Not sure if you're the right person to go to about this but since you hosted the housing webinar I figured I'd try reach out to you as well since I'm pretty desperate for a resolution to this issue. I will call UAH again first thing Monday morning. I'm sure this is a busy time of the year for you but I would be more than grateful for any help at all!                                                                                            So I'm an incoming PhD student in the electrical engineering department. In the housing application I indicated I'm not interested in the Arbor. Despite that, I was still assigned to the Arbor. This seems like a mistake because my friend, who is also an incoming SEAS PhD student, whom I specified as a roommate preference (who also specified me)--had the same thing happen to him: he was also assigned to the Arbor even though he didn't indicate interest in it, however, unlike me, he managed to get a call in to UAH Friday afternoon, and earlier this evening at 7pm he told me he was reassigned housing near campus.  I am absolutely certain living in the Arbor will not work for me, one reason being I will be working in the lab late--past shuttle hours--at which point returning to the Arbor will be prohibitively difficult. I feel I should get a reassignment just as another student did, as we are in equivalent situations. Please let me know if there's anything I can do to help fix this problem, such as being more flexible with my move in date. Thank you so much for your help. I'm looking forward to joining Columbia this fall.	Please call University Apartment Housing (UAH) regarding this issue, their number is availble here.	Issue	UAH

I am a prospective master's student in Operations Research at Columbia University starting this Fall.  I have an UAH account from my housing application from my previous year (I couldn't attend the master's program last year and I decided to reactivate my school application a year later).    I was wondering if I can use the same account for my application this year? Also would I still be on the waitlist from my previous application? That would be great! 	Last year's housing code is no longer valid. New incoming students only receive this year's application once they have submitted a deposit to enroll. I hope you will decide to join Columbia. If my information is outdated, and you've already submitted the deposit, you should be receiving the new housing application code and additional information from me on Monday. 	Reactivate	UAH

  I was wondering how likely it is for me to get housing now, since I submitted my application relatively late compared to the other prospective students?	As you know, UAH is extremely limited, and doctoral students are given priority.

I'm an incoming first-year Ph.D. student in X Department. I'm a little concerned because I just received my housing assignment through UAH for the fall, and I have been assigned a move-in date of August 26, a week after orientation starts for the School of Engineering. Is this disparity in time a normal occurrence? Is there anything I can do to work out an earlier move-in date? I am not from the New York area, so not having a place to stay and not being settled while starting orientation is a bit worrisome to me. If it is relevant or useful, the preferences I put in my housing application were the weeks of 8/8, 8/1, and 7/25 (although I understand we were not guaranteed our preferences in move-in date.) Thank you very much for your time.	Thank you for your email. Unfortunately, we are unable to guarantee an earlier move-in date, but UAH may be able to accommodate you, hopefully by 8/18.

I would like your help regarding the timing of submission of my official transcripts.  I am planning to register for classes in the first slot that's available which will be prior to my arrival in the U.S.   As I wanted to submit my official transcripts in person, i.e, on my arrival in August, will there be a hold for my registration in July because of this issue?  Also, If I decide to submit my transcripts before the registration via mail, is there a deadline to it before the registration of classes?	 Information regarding official transcripts is available in Step 2 here. Please note the deadline is October 7, so you will have time to submit your transcripts in person.

I had applied for UAH and I received an email today stating that my application has been approved. In my application, I had answered 'Yes' to the question:  " Are you applying for one of the University Apartment Housing dormitory rooms at International House? "  However, at the time, I did not realise that I would have to submit additional applications by post to both UAH office and the I-House office. I would like to change my answer to ​'No' at this point. Can I do that at this point without affecting my application status, since my application has already been approved but no specific housing has been allotted yet?
